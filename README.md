# Stochastic-Volatility

# Overview 
Hello, 

You may already know about my project, but for those who don't, I'm a Masters student in financial engineering and I've set myself a challenge called **OneWeekOneProject**. Each week, I dive deep into a new topic within the vast world of market finance and quantitative methods. This week's focus is on Stochastic Volatility Modeling and its implementation in Python.

In financial markets, volatility is not constant but varies over time. Traditional models often assume constant volatility, but real market behavior tells a different story. Stochastic Volatility (SV) models capture this dynamic nature, providing a more accurate representation of market conditions.

# Project Highlights

<ins>**Comprehensive SV Models**</ins>: Implementation of key stochastic volatility models such as the Heston model, which incorporates mean-reverting stochastic volatility.

**Parameter Estimation**: Use historical market data to estimate the Heston model parameters through maximum likelihood estimation or other statistical techniques.

Model comparison: Compare the performance of the Heston model with the Black-Scholes model by backtesting both models on historical data and evaluating their accuracy.

Monte Carlo simulation: Use Monte Carlo methods to simulate price paths and compute option prices under the Heston model.
